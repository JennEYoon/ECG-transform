### Plan of Action  
 * Explore poster formats.
 * Get SciPy poster specs.
 * Develop ResNet+SE model nb portion
 * Write other parts, think about images
 * Add interactive graphs using Plotly, Bokeh, Voila.  
 * 3D heart simulation using 12-signal chest signals? Similar to geoseismic visualization for oil drilling?  Contrast healthy strong heart to a feeble low-blood volume heart? Does something like this already exist? Maybe for medical education? Appropriate for my use case?
 * baby heart simulation 3d, get baby hear rate public data sources, maybe on 2 signal? Helpful in Afria, poor countries, diagnose sudden death, heart abnormality in babies.
