### 1. Quick Project Description:  

This repo contains a deep learning project for Areteus. (See https://www.areteus.us/)   
Areteus is developing a novel wearable ECG (heart rate signals) monitoring device. It's novel factors are: (1) continuously wearable at home and (2) comparable to hospital machines (12 or more signals). This AI project will customize ECG classification model(s) for Areteus's novel device. Visualization app showing live-feed ECG signals is also planned.  

### 2. Device Information:  

2.A) Areteus Device: See <a href="https://github.com/JennEYoon/ECG-transform/blob/main/_Wearable_ECG_Device.md" >_Wearable_ECG_Device.md</a>  
https://github.com/JennEYoon/ECG-transform/blob/main/_Wearable_ECG_Device.md

2.B) to write, hospital ECG devices  

2.C) at-home ECG devices
