### 1. Quick Repo Description:  
This repo contains a deep learning project for Areteus.us. (See https://www.areteus.us/)   
Areteus is developing a novel ECG heart rate detection wearable device. It's novel factors are (1) it is continuously wearable at home and (2) it is comparable to hospital machines in number of signals. This AI project will develop a customized AI model to classify live feeds of heart rate signals coming out of the wearable ECG device. An interactive visualization app will also be hosted online.
