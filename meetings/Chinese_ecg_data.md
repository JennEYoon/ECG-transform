The Shandong Provincial Hospital (SPH) 12-lead ECG Database is a large-scale, open-source dataset from China, widely utilized in AI classification research. It comprises 25,770 ECG records from 24,666 patients, each labeled with standardized diagnostic statements conforming to the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations.

Additionally, the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 (CPSC 2018) dataset is another significant open-source Chinese ECG dataset. It contains 10,330 ECG recordings, each lasting between 6 to 60 seconds, annotated with 23 different arrhythmia types.

We present a large 12-lead ECG dataset with standardized diagnostic statements conforming to the AHA/ACC/HRS recommendations (“AHA standard”). Our dataset contains 25770 12-lead clinical ECG records from 24666 patients (55.36% male and 44.64% female). The data were collected from Shandong Provincial Hospital from 2019/08 to 2020/08. The sampling frequency is 500 Hz and the length of records ranges from 10 to 60 seconds. Patient demographics such as age and sex are also included. 46.04% records in the dataset contain ECG abnormalities, which includes 44 primary statements and 15 modifiers as per the AHA standard. Especially, the separation of statements and modifiers as well as the pairing rules between them can characterize ECG more thoroughly, which is of great value to explore precise ECG analysis. 14.45% records in the database and 31.39% abnormal records have multiple diagnostic statements, providing the opportunity to develop and evaluate multi-label classification methods.
