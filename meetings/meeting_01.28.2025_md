# meeting notes   

Rodrigo back on AI. I thought he wa going to work on Aerver side application?  
He's going to work on Chinese dayaset, after I figured out how to use it.  
That's OK, try to create sample dataset and run simple model w 5 to 11 categories.  
Look for script to preprocess datasets.  

Follow up on PTB dataset, data reformatted to csv.  
Run 2 class model, then 5 class model, than 11 class model.  
Use clustering to show label groups from sample data.
