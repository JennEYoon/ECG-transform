# Meeting Notes, Jan 14, 2025  
Jennifer, Jason, Rodrigo  

Jennifer's Progress main points:  

### Chinese Dataset  
Quick review, looks good. Downloaded H5 format datafiles and associated meta data.  
Read article about dataset, how acquired.  
Possibility of having a new data source for different classes of heart arrhthmias.   

### Found competing devices selling for around $150 on Amazon  
AliveCor has 6-lead device.  
ECG image is sent to a cardiologist to reply with a reading, if subscripted to this service.  
Can view ECG chart on user's phone.  
Takes 30 second recording.  Some device saves upto 1000 images on device itself, others save to user's phone memory.  

  * KardiaMobile 6-lead, $150
