Hello, 
the datasheet of the device measures the signals as:
0x800000 represented the most negative value (-VREF).
0x000000 represented 0V.
0x7FFFFF represented the most positiveÂ valueÂ (+VREF)

Are you using hexadecimal?
yes

Looks good. If you can send me a file with 8 signals, any length of time, that would be great.  10 seconds to 60 secondsÂ workÂ well.

Is the units microvolts?
yes milivolts

sure, Do you already know how the sensor samples areÂ structured?
Not sure.
Don't know what that means.  I can convert binary numbers to floatingÂ pointÂ baseÂ 10.


Is how the data is received from theÂ device

fig3 ECG message structure  

Do you have a file with outputs from the prototype ecg device?  If I can get a copy I can take a look at it.  I will have questions about the data structure and number formats but maybe easier to understand after I get the file.  If Vadim has a copy, sameÂ oneÂ mayÂ work.

htx.txt file  (10 blocks, 125 sample per half second, 5 second total recording)  
every 125 samples we have a 20 bytes header, that you can ignoreÂ forÂ now...

Here the header say is 16 bytes, but right nowÂ is:Â 20

Other detail is that ESP32 is a Little Endian architecture, the bytes are stored in memory in reverse order from what you wrote:

Byte 0 -> F4
Byte 1 -> 12
Byte 2 -> FA
Byte 3 -> FA
Byte 4 -> 44
Byte 5 -> A4
Byte 6 ->Â 00
ByteÂ 7Â ->Â 00

this is the device ID:  0000A444FAFA12F4

That's a good point. Thanks for letting me know it's LittleÂ Endian

What is the time interval for each row?  Or is the time interval one block of numbers? Where thereÂ isÂ emptyÂ row?

yes, the empty row separates each 125Â samples

also I add a "." that means the end of the 125Â samples

Is there a time measure? 125 samples per second per signal lead? OrÂ somethingÂ else?
125 every half second

Ok thanks.  If this file has 8 leads, are they always in the same order? In terms of body contact points V1 ... V6,Â limbÂ 1,Â etc?
Or maybe that does not matter at thisÂ point?

yes, Jason told me that lead1 is right to left arm, lead2 is right arm to left leg. the othersÂ areÂ forÂ theÂ v's

Ok that's great.  I can go from here. Thank you for explaining it to me.  Take care,Â JenniferÂ ðŸ˜Š

no problem, have a nice dayÂ :)
You too.  ðŸŒžsun  

### 5/15 Th update:  
Header bytes are 20 not 16, in updated chip specs.  
Device ID 8 bytes, random init 4 bytes, Unix Date-time 8 bytes.  
OK now everything fits in Feb 19 hex recording.  

Today's 2 hex files, together is 7mb, I think not repeat yesterday's binary file.  
So 15 samples, 10 seconds long, each block ends with "DONE". 125 numbers x 8 channels per half second, 300 hertz per second x 8 channels. Lead 1 to 8 in order, Rt.arm-Lf.arm, Rt.arm-Lf.leg, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.  

Yesterday's binary unbroken text file, 7mb.  
Can now convert to hex with confidence. 
20 header bytes, 125 samples, 27-byte data (8 channel).  
Each half second sample ends in "DONE"   
"\"\   
I can convert later if Alondra does not convert to hex first.  
14.7 samples, 10 seconds long.

Together will make about 30 samples, each 10 seconds long, taken from one human, Alondra.  
Enough sample size to meet large or large numbers and central tendency minimal threshold.
