# Practice loading train.pt format dataset  

Use Pytorch to test loading train.pt from ECGTransform repo  
Do data exploration, data storage structure.  

How is model structure saved?  Model weights saved?  Pre-trained model was downloaded, what was source model used???  
ECG data - look for foundation models for this.
