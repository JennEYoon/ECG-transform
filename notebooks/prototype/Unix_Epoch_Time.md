## What is the epoch time in Linux?

Epoch time is based on the number of seconds since 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, and is used to record dates/times on Linux systems in an abbreviated format. For example, Jan 2, 1970 (12:00:00 AM GMT), would have been saved as 86400 (that many seconds later than Jan 1, 1970).
