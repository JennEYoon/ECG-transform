# Timeline  

### AI models, datasets research and customization:  
 * Project start, Jason calls - Sept - Nov 2024
 * Stage 1: Initial research - Nov 2024 - January 2025
 * Stage 2: Deeper research, large, 12-signal datasets & papers - February - March 2025  
 * Stage 2B: Develop ResNet + SE model, 12-signal: May 2025
    - compare w plain ResNet, 12-signals treat as 12-dim channel inputs.
    - compare w simple CNN, but with longer epochs, 2 and 6 classes, then 24-27 classes.
    - compare w Transformer-based 12-signal models.
    - try 6 and 12 classes for higher accuracy.
    - compare datasets from different hospitals, systematic bias?   
 * Develop Demo of final AI on hospital dataset: July - August 2025
 * Areteus device testing and AI model refinements: August - September 2025
 * Deploy Areteus AI app, live device signals & continuous AI classifications: Nov 2025 
   
### SciPy 2025 Conference:  
 * SciPy talk proposal submit - March 5-7, 2025
 * Accepted for virtual poster - April 27, 2025   
 * Build & test ResNet+SE model - May 20-31, 2025
   (use for class project, Stanford Tech 07)
 * Optional, submit article to SciPy Proceedings - draft due June 6, 2025 Friday    
    - max 6000 words, Proceedings repo pull request.    
 * Submit poster to conference organizers - About June 30 - July 4, 2025    
 * Create related videos, slide deck, blog post - June - July 7, 2025
 * Present: July 9-11, 2025  

### ToDos  

 * call Alondra, get more samples - done.  
 * reformat device output sample, convert to csv.
 * SciPy - get dates, formats info. links to poster info, May 13 email. View author video too, optional.   
 * Grace class final project, May 31, 2025 due. Doesn't have to be final, send link. Finish before class.  
   * ResNet + SE notebooks, visualizations. Some interactive charts.   
   * What story are you telling? most important.
   * What is one new thing not covered in class? Whole project is new methods.   
   * Data - have more info about data processing methods, decisions. Visuals. Write how the data changed after ML models become available, since 2018-2020. Standardized diagnostic labels.
