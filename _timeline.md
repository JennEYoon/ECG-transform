# Timeline  

### AI models, datasets research and customization:  
 * Project start, Jason calls - Oct - Nov 2024
 * Stage 1: Initial research - Nov 2024 - January 2025
 * Stage 2: Deeper research, 12-signal datasets & papers - February - March 2025  
 * Stage 2B: Develop ResNet + SE model, 12-signal: May 2025
    - compare w plain ResNet, 12-signals treat as 12-dim channel inputs.
    - compare w simple CNN, but with longer epochs, 2 and 6 classes, then 24-27 classes.
    - compare w Transformer-based 12-signal models.
    - try 6 and 12 classes for higher accuracy. Test datasets from different hospitals, 12-signal large.  
 * Stage 2C: SciPy virtual poster presentation prep: June 2025
 * Stage 2D: develop Demo of AI models on hospital datasets: July 2025
 * Stage 3: Areteus device, detailed testing, AI model refinements: August - September 2025
 * Deploy Areteus AI app, live device signals & continuous AI classifications: Nov 2025  
   
### SciPy 2025 Conference:  
 * SciPy talk proposal submit - March 5-7, 2025
 * Work on virtual poster, record videos: May - June 2025
 * Present: July 9-11, 2025  

### ToDos  

 * call Alondra, get more samples
 * reformat device output sample, convert to csv.
 * SciPy - get dates, formats info.  
 * Grace class final project, May 31, 2025 due. ResNet + SE notebooks, visualizations. Some interactive charts.
