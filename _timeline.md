# Timeline  

### AI models, datasets research and customization:  
 * Project start, Jason calls - Oct - Nov 2024
 * Stage 1: Initial research - Nov 2024 - January 2025
 * Stage 2: Deeper research, 12-signal datasets & papers - February - March 2025  
 * Stage 2B: Develop ResNet + SE model, 12-signal: May 2025
    - compare w simpler ResNet, 12-signals treat as 12-dim channel inputs.
    - compare w simple CNN, but with longer epochs, 2 and 6 classes, then 24-27 classes. 
    - Review Transformer+ 2nd stage models for 12-signals, papers,
    - re-run ECGTransform paper/model w 2-classes PTB 12-signal (small, original) dataset, 6-classes MIT 2-signal dataset.  
 * Stage 2C: Report writing, SciPy poster presentation prep: June 2025
 * Demo AI models, hospital datasets: July 2025
 * Areteus device, detailed testing, AI model refinements: August - September 2025
 * Areteus AI app deploy, device live signals & continuous AI classifications: Nov 2025  
   
### SciPy 2025 Conference:  
 * SciPy talk proposal submit - March 5-7, 2025
 * Work on virtual poster, record videos: May - June 2025
 * Present: July 9-11, 2025  

### ToDos  

 * call Alondra, get more samples
 * reformat Alondra sample, convert to csv.
 * SciPy - get dates, formats info.
