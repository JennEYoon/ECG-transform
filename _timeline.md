# Timeline  

### AI models, datasets research and customization:  
 * Project start, Jason calls - Sept - Nov 2024
 * Stage 1: Initial research - Nov 2024 - January 2025
 * Stage 2: Deeper research, large, 12-signal datasets & papers - February - March 2025  
 * Stage 2B: Develop ResNet + SE model, 12-signal: May 2025
    - compare w plain ResNet, 12-signals treat as 12-dim channel inputs.
    - compare w simple CNN, but with longer epochs, 2 and 6 classes, then 24-27 classes.
    - compare w Transformer-based 12-signal models.
    - try 6 and 12 classes for higher accuracy.
    - compare datasets from different hospitals, systematic bias?
 * Stage 2C: data augmentation (from public datasets to simulate noisy device data)  
    - Gemimi AI deep research mode - develop synthetic augmented data for v1-v6 node location variance, body movement and shirt noise variance, powerline interference.  
    - Jason, collect abnormal heart data from Pt Reyes? When? Delayed to August or later.
    - Jason, to send me 1 ECG device, me to test user error data from device. Delayed    
 * SciPy poster: June 2025, due June 30, 2025 Monday.     
 * Develop Demo of final AI on hospital dataset: Later half of 2025
 * Areteus device testing and AI model refinements: August - October 2025
 * Deploy Areteus AI app, live device signals & continuous AI classifications: Nov 2025
