# Data  
to download from single source, 2021 CinC challenge,  
All 5 sources, includeds Shandong  
12.6 GB  
Not done, includes papers, esp top 2 winning models.  


Last week Rodrigo, ref same sources, but file size 4.6 GB.  excl Shandong source
Rodrigo dataset from 2020 CinC Physionet challenge seems identical. Already in MATLAB .mat and .hea formats. Easy to use in Python.  
Only missing SPH dataset, Shandong Prov Hospital. Then complete.  

Don't have to worry about fixing server side download error(s). Don't need to go to AWS. Same datasets repeated in 2021 as used in 2020 CinC Challenge.
