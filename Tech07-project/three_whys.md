# Three Whys  
Related document to Tech07 Slides presentation.  

Why 1) Why did I choose to apply peak centering to sample ECG data, instead of random sampling and overlapping sampling?  


Why 2) Why did I choose to use ResNet+SE model versus CNN or Random Forest model for 12-signal PTB-XL dataset?  


Why 3) Why build a wearable, home-use ECG device?  

    * Add 3 slides, why peak centering vs random cplitting, why ResNet SE - small hump in lesser V lead, swaped in channel pooling, why wearable device, some pre-existing conditions benefit from continuous monitoring at home, health enthu;siasts - quantified health, post workout heart recovery for peak athletic performance, cheaper alternatiev in poor contried, local clinic can filter conditions and recommend going to a big city for hopital ECG machine and doctors.
