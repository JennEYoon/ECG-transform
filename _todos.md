# To Dos   

### ToDos July 13, 2025:  
Connections:  
 * Grace, ask for LinkedIn recommendation
 * SciPy people - contacts, networked  
 * Sanhita - contacted, to review 1-2 papers for proceedings.
   - 2 papers assigned, finish this Saturday July 26, 2025  

### ToDos July 23, 2025:  
Coding:  
 * finish landing page for external audience. 
   July 31 to finish.   
 * Run simple time-series model w aug data, post results table.  

### Todos Future:  

Application on web - August, for job search:  
 * Create simple clasifier app, choose data source as ptbxl g1 or augmented data g1
   Later add SPH and also Areteus live data, if any  

Marketing: 
 * Post at my websites, present at local Meetups.
 * Create documentation for other readers to repo. Package repo for showing.
 * Maybe create a new repo with smaller size, demonstration pages w poster onply?  

Models more runs: - create results page  
 * Run time-serie model, orig data, aug data
 * Run filtered on aug data, time-series, 1dcnn
 * Run filteres on original data, time-series, 1dcnn
 * Expand dataset to SPH g1
 * Expand datasets to all PTBXL
 * Expand dataset to all SPH
 * Expand dataset to joint SPH and PTBXL

### June 19, 2025 11:30PM -- clone to WSL, local repo moved.  

### To Dos May-June 2025
   * ResNet + SE notebooks, visualizations. Some interactive charts.   
   * What story are you telling? most important.
   * What is one new thing not covered in class? Whole project is new methods.   
   * Data - have more info about data processing methods, decisions. Visuals. Write how the data changed after ML models become available, since 2018-2020. Standardized diagnostic labels.
   * PTB-XL data - load many files, peak center, baseline zero, split and zero pad, save into efficient file format.
   * Header info, somehow use to create labels matching each data file. - can directly\ use sample regularization expressions from explore nb or setup ns.  
   * Time file I/O read write. Is it really a problem? Test local GPU and Colab GPU.
   * Running model - may want to try paid Colab.
   * For Grace class, just use g1 folder, 1000 samples,x 10 heartbeats. 10K samples should get good performance.
