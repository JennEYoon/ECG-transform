# To Dos, May 2025  

ToDos  

 * call Alondra, get more samples - done.  
 * reformat device output sample, convert to csv.
 * SciPy - get dates, formats info. links to poster info, May 13 email. View author video too, optional.   
 * Grace class final project, May 31, 2025 due. Doesn't have to be final, send link. Finish before class.  
   * ResNet + SE notebooks, visualizations. Some interactive charts.   
   * What story are you telling? most important.
   * What is one new thing not covered in class? Whole project is new methods.   
   * Data - have more info about data processing methods, decisions. Visuals. Write how the data changed after ML models become available, since 2018-2020. Standardized diagnostic labels.
   * PTB-XL data - load many files, peak center, baseline zero, split and zero pad, save into efficient file format.
   * Header info, somehow use to create labels matching each data file. - can directly\ use sample regularization expressions from explore nb or setup ns.  
   * Time file I/O read write. Is it really a problem? Test local GPU and Colab GPU.
   * Running model - may want to try paid Colab.
   * For Grace class, just use g1 folder, 1000 samples,x 10 heartbeats. 10K samples should get good performance.
