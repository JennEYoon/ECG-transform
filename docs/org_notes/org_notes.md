# How to organize data science repo projects,   
to help write documentation, project reports along the way.  

#### Folder Structures:   
/project-root  
│── /data                # Raw and processed datasets  
│── /notebooks           # Jupyter notebooks for analysis  
│── /scripts             # Python scripts for modeling, preprocessing, etc.  
│── /docs                # Documentation and reports  
│    ├── report.md       # Main project report  
│    ├── references.md   # Links, articles, and resources   
│    ├── notes.md        # Short texts and observations  
│── README.md            # Project overview  
│── requirements.txt     # Dependencies  
│── .gitignore           # Ignore unnecessary files  


Me:   
│── /notebooks           # Jupyter notebooks for analysis  
│    ├── readme.md       # Main notebooks highlight, tag important ones as I go.   
│    ├── notes.md        # Important thoughts, snippets, to include in reports later, as I go.
