how to embed interactive charts on website 

ChatGPT session, Feb 16, 2025

Q.) When embedding notebook results in a website, what are some tools for adding interactive charts? I would like to use Plotly. What are some examples other people have used to embed a data science notebook in a website?

A. 1)  
Embedding interactive charts and Data Science notebook outputs on a website is a powerful way to share your work. **Plotly** is a great choice for interactive visualizations, and there are several tools and workflows to integrate notebooks into a website.

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Using Plotly in a Jupyter Notebook**
Plotly charts are HTML and JavaScript-based, making them easy to export and embed.

Example:
```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Sample Data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Time": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "Heart Rate": [72, 85, 90, 88, 76]
})

# Create Plotly Chart
fig = px.line(df, x="Time", y="Heart Rate", title="Heart Rate Over Time")
fig.write_html("interactive_chart.html")  # Save as standalone HTML
fig.show()
```

You can:
1. **Embed the HTML output** directly into your website.
2. Host the chart and link to it.

### üìä **3. Example Workflows to Embed Notebooks**

#### **A. Using Plotly + Voila**
1. Install Voila:
   ```bash
   pip install voila
   ```
2. Run Voila to serve notebooks:
   ```bash
   voila notebooks/your_notebook.ipynb
   ```
3. **Embed it on your website** using an `<iframe>`:
   ```html
   <iframe src="https://your-server.com/your-notebook" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
   ```

#### **B. Using Binder for Interactive Notebooks**
1. Ensure your GitHub repo has the notebook and `requirements.txt`.
2. Generate a Binder link using [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/).
3. Embed the **interactive notebook**:
   ```html
   <iframe src="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/username/repo/main?filepath=notebooks/your_notebook.ipynb" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
   ```

### üåê **4. Examples of Embedded Data Science Notebooks**
1. **Plotly Dash App**: Interactive ECG signal analysis dashboards (real-time chart updates).  
   Example: [Dash ECG Example](https://dash.plotly.com/)  
2. **Binder + Jupyter**: Share notebooks with interactive ECG signal visualization.  
   Example: [Binder Notebook Example](https://mybinder.org/)  
3. **JupyterBook**: Publish scientific notebooks with Plotly charts.  
   Example: [Jupyter Book Example](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)  

---

### üìå **Recommendation for Your ECG Project**  
1. **For static but interactive charts**: Use `fig.write_html()` and embed via `<iframe>`.  
2. **For fully interactive notebooks**: Use **Voila** or **Binder** to share live notebooks.  
3. **For a full report**: Use **JupyterBook** for your ECG analysis documentation.

## üöÄ **Tools for Embedding Notebooks & Interactive Charts**

1. **Plotly**  
   - Create fully interactive plots directly in your notebook.  
   - Export charts as **HTML files** or embed them directly in web pages.

   ```python
   import plotly.express as px
   
   fig = px.line(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[10, 20, 30], title="Sample Line Plot")
   fig.write_html("chart.html")
   ```

2. **Voila**  
   - Turns Jupyter notebooks into interactive web apps (without showing code).  
   - Perfect for demos where users interact with widgets and visualizations.

   ```bash
   pip install voila
   voila your_notebook.ipynb
   ```
   - Run locally or deploy to platforms like **Render** or **Binder**.

3. **NBViewer + GitHub**  
   - Use **NBViewer** to render notebooks online:  
   ```plaintext
   https://nbviewer.org/github/username/repo/blob/main/notebooks/your_notebook.ipynb
   ```

4. **Streamlit**  
   - A Python framework for building data apps.  
   - Great for live data visualizations and dashboards.

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   streamlit run your_script.py

## üåê **Examples of Embedded Notebooks & Visualizations**

1. **MIT Deep Learning for Health**  
   - Uses Plotly for interactive ECG signal analysis.  
   - Published notebooks via **GitHub Pages** and linked using **NBViewer**.

2. **Google Colab + HTML Export**  
   - Colab notebooks export directly as HTML, preserving Plotly interactivity.  
   - You can then embed them in any site via an `<iframe>`:  

   ```html
   <iframe src="chart.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
   ```

3. **Kaggle Notebooks as Web Reports**  
   - Notebooks hosted on **Kaggle** can be embedded or linked.  
   - Use **Plotly** or **Seaborn** for interactive charts and then share the notebook link.
